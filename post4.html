                    <p>This article foregrounds India's challenges: an increase in air pollution and a decrease in air
                        quality standards, mainly after Diwali, and what kind of solutions we should adopt to
                        combat this crisis. On Diwali, many oil lamps or candles are lit up that symbolise
                        victory over darkness; along with this, fireworks are set off as part of the celebrations -
                        their smoke causing pollution that takes days to clear. As people celebrated Diwali with
                        late-night crackers despite being banned in multiple cities, on the next day in Delhi, along
                        with many Indo Gangetic plan's cities, AQI rose severely.
                    </p>

                    <p>Thick smog turned daylight into dusk in and around Delhi, with the car and building lights
                        only barely penetrating the murk and the ubiquitous detritus of firecrackers coating the
                        ground. Delhi's pollution index surged to 463 on a scale of 500. The air concentration of fine
                        particulate matter (PM2.5) rose to as high as 1000 micrograms per cubic meter at some
                        stations. Still, according to standard guidelines, it should not increase by more than 24
                        micrograms per cubic meter.
                    </p>

                    <p>Airborne PM2.5 can cause cardiovascular and respiratory diseases such as lung cancer. And, in
                        India, toxic air kills more than a million people annually. A 2020 report by Swiss organization
                        IQAir found 22 of the world's 30 most polluted cities were in India, with New Delhi ranked the
                        most polluted capital globally. The same year, the Lancet said 1.67 million deaths were
                        attributable to air pollution in India in 2019, including almost 17,500 in the capital New Delhi
                        alone.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Why does air pollution rise in October in Delhi and around it each year?
                    </h2>

                    <p>Farmers' subtle crop burning is often accused of, but crop stubble fires contribute only
                        35% of Delhi's smog. Air pollution in Delhi and the Indo Gangetic Plains is a complex
                        phenomenon dependent on various factors. Every year in October, Delhi's air quality
                        starts to dip, and a war of words between different governments erupts.
                    </p>

                    <p>Increases in Air pollution of Delhi and Indo-Gangetic plains are mainly due to three
                        reasons:-
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Input of air pollutants</b></li>
                        <p>
                            As soon as the monsoon withdraws, the predominant direction of wind changes to
                            northwest. During summers, the movement of the wind is northwestern, and
                            storms carry dust from Rajasthan and sometimes Pakistan and Afghanistan.
                            According to a report published by scientists at the National Physical Laboratory, 72
                            percent of Delhi's wind in winters comes from the northwest, and only 28 percent
                            comes from the Indo-Gangetic plains. In 2017, a storm that originated in Iraq, Saudi
                            Arabia, and Kuwait led to a drastic dip in Delhi's air quality in a couple of days.
                        </p>
                        <li><b>Weather factors</b></li>
                        <p>
                            Temperature dip is one of the reasons for the rise in air pollution. In the winter
                            season, when the temperature starts decreasing, it lowers the thermal inversion
                            height. The pollutants will not disperse after a certain height and the concentration
                            of pollutants in the air increases.
                        </p>
                        <li><b>Local conditions</b></li>
                        <p>
                            At this time, farmers of Haryana, Punjab, and parts of UP are prepare a new sowing
                            cycle, and stubble burning is one of the easiest way of getting rid of the straw
                            stubble that remains after grains, such as rice and wheat, have been harvested.
                            In 2015 IIT Kanpur and SAFAR released a report stating that Delhi's air pollution
                            contains 17-26% of all particle matter from biomass burning.
                        </p>
                    </ol>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Other prominent sources of pollution in Delhi and solutions to this
                        hazardous problem
                    </h2>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The central and state government had come up with many policies to control air
                                pollution, but most policies were implemented poorly. Like every year, firecrackers are
                                banned
                                in Delhi by either the government or the supreme court. Still, there are many
                                firecrackers sold due to lack of implementationsss. So these policies should be
                                implemented strictly.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                These policies should not be applied to Delhi only, but other state governments
                                around Delhi should also apply them.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Vehicular pollution is the second biggest cause of pollution in winters. According to
                                the IIT Kanpur study, 20 % of PM 2.5 comes from vehicular pollution in winters.
                                Government should promote more and more Electric vehicles and the use of public
                                transport.

                                Some minor offenses like garbage burning, leaf burning, dust control, etc., are left
                                unseen, but these largely contribute to spreading pollutants should be prohibited.

                                management. Government should improve it.

                                Delhi and its surrounding states have a lot of agencies for controlling air pollution,
                                but due to lack of coordination, they used to delay in response. The response system
                                to check pollution should be quick and urgent to improve the results.
