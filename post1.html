                    <p>Time and again, environmental concern has touched upon us, but it often failed to
                        spark the masses to stop and reflect. The United Nations’ IPCC has come up with its 6th
                        Assessment Report on climate change and, the facts, figures, and possibilities it has
                        put forth in front of us have baffled us more than ever. This blog intends to outline the
                        crucial points of the assessment report and give a hint of the imminent dangers and
                        catastrophic future we’re heading towards.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">What is IPCC, and why is it important?</h2>
                    <p>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, is a body under the United
                        Nations that came into being to analyze, express and integrate the scientific
                        information concerning the global climate policies and their impact on all the fields of
                        the world. Their reports are written and scrutinized in various steps, thus guaranteeing
                        objectivity and transparency.</p>

                    <p>Scientists and policymakers treat these reports as the backbone of our
                        understanding of climate change. The IPCC does not do its original research from
                        scratch. They’re written by experts in the relevant subjects, including people like
                        physicists, atmospheric and oceanic scientists, energy specialists, economists, etc .
                        Through the years, IPCC has contributed immensely to the vital debate of human
                        influence on climate change. It tries to center its work on factual information instead of
                        making opinionated judgments.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Current State of the Climate</h2>

                    <p>The IPCC confirms what we already know and can see in the world around us. From
                        wildfires, because of extreme heat, moisture loss to devastating floods, because of
                        extreme rain events, the future quite simply is here, and it should worry us
                        enormously. Discussing in terms of numbers, the world could be hit with a rise of
                        1.5o Celsius rise as early as 2040, which means that the speed of rising emissions
                        and the consequent temperature increase has accelerated many folds over these
                        last few decades.</p>

                    <p>This report is different because, for the first time, scientists at IPCC have come
                        together and are no longer coy about telling us that climate change is caused by
                        human-related activities that are clear. However, they are going a step further to
                        attribute climate change to specific extreme weather events. Hence, we know with
                        greater certainty today of the role of climate change and say the extreme heat
                        event in Canada or the wildfires in Greece which are happening today or the floods
                        in Germany this is new and important.
                    </p>

                    <p>The report breaks down today’s climate change in much more detail than just
                        globally average temperature rises. Whether that’s in rainfall pattern changes,
                        ocean heat waves, sea level rises, weather pattern changes, the report emphasizes
                        the plethora of ways our climate is already changing, Thanks to our actions! Many of
                        the climate changes we’re causing now are irreversible. Meanwhile, fast-melting
                        arctic ice creates sea levels that aren’t just rising but surging at a rapidly
                        accelerating pace. According to the report, the annual rate of sea-level rise
                        increased by 46 mm/year from the first 70 years of the 20th century to the period
                        between 1971 - 2006, but in the last 15 years alone, that rate has almost doubled.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Possible Climate Futures</h2>
                    <p>Discussing the future, the report puts forth five illustrative scenarios or possibilities
                        we can presume heading towards us.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The most optimistic (with real possibility tending to zero) scenario expects the
                            world to shift towards sustainability to such an extent that we cut down the
                            global <sub>CO2</sub> emissions to net-zero by the end of 2050. Even if we ideally bring
                            this scenario to reality, we’d still be around the 1.5<sup>o</sup>C above preindustrial era,
                            but positively not for anything worse.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The second scenario doesn’t promise the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions going to net-zero
                            anything around 2050, but cutting them enough, through socio-economic
                            sustainability, to stabilize the warming number at 1.8<sup>o</sup>C by 2100.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The mid-way scenario presumes the world going at the same pace regarding
                            socio-economic factors and environmental deterioration. The expected rise in
                            the temperature in such a case would be 2.7<sup>o</sup>C by the end of the century.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The fourth scenario speculates that the world is getting more intense in
                            competition, national security, and individual food supplies. The CO<sub>2</sub>
                            emissions are expected to go roughly double the present number leading to a
                            3.6<sup>o</sup>C average temperature rise.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The worst-case scenario, the future that fears, theorizes the world’s global
                            economy growing at the highest possible pace, but at the cost of depriving
                            away the fossil fuels recklessly. In this case, the average global temperature
                            gets to a blazing 4.4<sup>o</sup>C higher.<br><br>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                        <i style="font-size:0.7em;">(In the graph, SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5

                    <p>
                        The increase in average global temperature is not the only stat we need to focus
                        on. However, it gives an idea of the severity, being proportionate to the several
                        extremums concerning the global water cycle, global monsoon precipitation, soil
                        moisture, and acuteness of wet and dry events.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Limiting Future Climate Change</h2>
                    <p>The report puts the reduction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions at the center stage
                        while dealing with the possibilities of limiting environmental degradation in the
                        coming times. The thing is that even this most aggressive emissions-cutting
                        scenario has it likely that the global temperatures rise by more than 1.5o C. In other
                        words, even if we incredibly aggressively cut emissions, there’s a good chance that
                        this limit set by the Paris Climate Agreement as its more ambitious target will be
                        breached. This is not good news. Limiting global warming to 1.5o C is profoundly
                        important for the most vulnerable people and fragile ecosystems on the planet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, the report makes it clear time and time again that every bit of warming
                        matters. Every bit of emissions matters; the truth is that the world won’t end if we
                        heat it by more than 1.5 degrees, but some people’s worlds will end even if we
                        heat it by less than 1.5 degrees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Carbon pricing looks at the problem with a pretty clear vision. If releasing carbon
                        dioxide is free, people don’t have any reason not to do it. But it’s not free. It’s
                        going to cost plenty of money to deal with the consequences of that carbon
                        emission.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Climate change news is like a constant background sound of the alarm. You know
                        that something’s wrong, but perhaps you get used to the noise. But then reading
                        the IPCC report is like someone suddenly opening the window, and all that noise
                        hits you at once.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you’ve heard the alarm the IPCC has sounded, and activists have been ringing for
                        decades, we encourage you to get involved. It is hard to hear and read about these
                        objective disaster scenarios, but we’ve got a set of facts, piles of data, and the
                        knowledge to deal with this mess.
