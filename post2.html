                    <p>We doubt whether there is anyone who hasn't seen the Shiba Inu Coin meme? Musk's madness for the
                        Cryptocurrency (or his wilful manipulation of the Cryptomarket) making it more or less a "meme
                        stock". It will be naive to ignore the upheavals in the Cryptomarket. Cryptos have the potential
                        to challenge our preconceived notion of fiat money to become the "new-normal" mode of payment of
                        this era.
                    </p>

                    <p>Bitcoin (BTC) is the first digital currency to lead the #CryptoFever among the tech-savvy worldly
                        fellows. The pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto developed Bitcoin. Satoshi wanted BTC to be
                        medium for instantaneous, borderless transactions, without the high fees or foreign exchange
                        barriers. Never-ever in his wildest dreams, he would have thought that his creation will become
                        a speculating asset for the profit craving crowd and will value it at 1BTC=35lakhs.
                    </p>

                    <p>An article in ET says that though the Government is chary with the crypto bourse, the GenZs of
                        India are bullish on the "de-fi" prospects.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">But how on earth does Bitcoin affect the Environment?</h2>

                    <p>To understand this problem let me explain the design of cryptocurrency in layman terms (or let me
                        say in "simple" terms). </p>

                    <p>Blockchain technology is the base of almost all cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin). Blockchain
                        is a database containing blocks of information. Each of the blocks has a unique Hash ID of
                        64-bit hexadecimal numbers and some information. The block also contains the Hash ID of the
                        previous blocks and thus, they form a "chain" i.e., irreversible by nature.
                    </p>

                    <p>Bitcoin has decentralized blockchain-based initiation i.e., the blockchain is not kept in a
                        centralized server but remains distributed among fellow users. This creates a trust deficit
                        because anyone can change the data in the blocks, to evade this problem Satoshi conceptualized
                        the idea of "mining". The "miners" verify each of the blocks of data (containing information of
                        transactions) and in turn, they get a cut from the parties involved in transactions and also the
                        Bitcoin system offers them 6.25BTC (as of today, equivalent to Rs 2crore 20lakhs). In this way,
                        a new coin gets added to the system. This is the idea of the "Proof of Work" concept.
                    </p>

                    <p>But the crux of the "Bitcoin Mining" is:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Only the first Miner who has produced the correct number gets the Money offered by the
                            system.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The process of verification is guessing a 256-bit number &lt;= the number produced by SHA256
                            hashing algo applied on the block. This process of verification is a computationally
                            heavy (very heavy!) task.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When there is more computing power working to mine for bitcoins, the system automatically
                            increases the difficulty level of mining to keep block production at a stable rate. <br><br>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        In 2009, When the first bitcoin was mined, it was close to worthless, and people could mine a
                        bitcoin even with a PC at home. But now there are close to 1 million unique active miners in the
                        Bitcoin network alone. With this much computing crowd ordinary computers like ours, can’t
                        perform such intense calculations and will simply melt (like butter..). For this purpose, we
                        need powerful computing devices called rigs augmented with GPUs and ASICs with an efficient
                        cooling system.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">This is where the problem begins...</h2>
                    <p><b>Power Hungry Machines</b>: These powerful devices need a lot of electricity. Even the most
                        efficient
                        computers would still take about 13 terawatt-hours in a year. That’s enough to power the 3
                        million homes of the USA.

                    <p>
                        To remain profitable, bitcoin miners use the dirt-cheap source of electricity - COAL and FOSSIL
                        FUELS, the major source of carbon emission. In search of cheap power, miners flocked to China.
                        The Northern and Southwestern parts of China, which generate most of their energy from coal and
                        hydropower plants, were the home of close to 70% of bitcoin miners, up until April this year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to a recent study of Cambridge University, approx. 61% of the energy used for the
                        Mining BTC comes from non-renewable sources. But pro-crypto research firms, like Coin Shares,
                        are proponents of BTC mining. They argue that 74.1% of the electricity powering the BTC network
                        comes from renewable sources and thus, BTC mining is "more renewables-driven than almost every
                        other large-scale industry in the world".
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Electronic Waste adds another dimension</b>: BTC Mining also generates a large amount of
                        electronic waste as hardware often gets "roasted". Unlike other computer hardware, these
                        circuits are often not reusable.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Let's NOT make it a moral debate... </h2>
                    <p>
                        Whether we are in favour of cryptocurrencies or against them, we have to agree upon the
                        following points:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Bitcoin uses enormous amounts of energy</b>: Although cryptocurrency advocates have argued
                        that
                        renewable sources are also a major component, in reality, much of this energy comes from burning
                        fossil fuels. There are disputes in exact figures, but even the best-case scenarios state that
                        mining is a major factor in carbon dioxide emissions.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>"Proof of Work" is the mother of all these problems.</b>
                        Environmental impact aside, right now electricity costs eat into an estimated 28% of Bitcoin
                        mining’s profitability. Also, the added competition is diminishing the profitability.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Epilogue</h2>
                    <p>
                        Provided hardening of the stance of West on Emission requirements combined with eternal air of
                        suspicion on "De-fi" and pressure from environmental activists, the pro-crypto community has to
                        take the moral onus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a group of sustainability seekers (with a soft Corner for Technology), we are of the opinion
                        that the upgradation/ modification in the "Proof of Work" concept is the need of the hour. The
                        potential of Blockchain is immense (especially in the Payment sector).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As we have learned from history that any technology or product (be it a wheel or an airplane)
                        undergoes an iterative process of modification till it suits the desired level, the same is true
                        for crypto-technologies as well. Rather than banning it, encouraging, and taking positive steps
                        in formulating new ideas and proposals will be an amicable solution.
