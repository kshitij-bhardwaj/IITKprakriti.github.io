                    <p>Once an abundant natural resource, water is becoming a more valuable commodity. The exponential
                        growth of economy in India has brought in a renewed demand for water for various purposes. As
                        the
                        population increases, so does the need for fresh water. Widespread Manufacturing and
                        industrialization require uninterrupted water supplies. Water is used to cool engines, machinery
                        and
                        to clean vehicles and aircraft parts. Liquid cooling in High- Performance computer is currently
                        an
                        important field of research.
                    </p>

                    <p>I won't be harping more on the necessity of water or its uses, as any sane person can conceive
                        that life
                        without water is impossible.
                    </p>

                    <p>Population booms, coupled with climate change, overexploitation, and lack of a collective social
                        conscience, made sustainable use of water a challenge. Scarcity of water puts significant
                        constraints on
                        increasing food production for the growing population, economic growth, and protection of social
                        and
                        environmental goals. Added to this, the increasing competition and conflicts over sharing of
                        shrinking
                        resources result in water scarcity emerging as a significant source of threat to social security
                        and
                        protection of ecosystems.
                    </p>

                    <p>Growing competition over finite water resources, backed by climate change,
                        will have severe ramifications on India’s food security and the livelihoods of its farmers. It
                        is often “joked” that the 3rd WW will be fought not for territorial integrity but for the basic
                        amenities
                        of life (Drinkable water being the primary component).
                    </p>

                    <p>The “thirst” of our ever-growing cities is mostly met by overexploiting groundwater, which puts
                        massive pressure on the depleting groundwater level. Freshwater supplies are increasingly coming
                        under
                        the threat of pollution from industrial effluents and municipal waste. The present situation is
                        grim, with the per capita freshwater availability declining from 6008 m3 per annum in 1947 to
                        approximately
                        2200 m3 per annum after 50 years.
                    </p>

                    <p>India’s water resources are not evenly distributed. Half of India's annual precipitation falls in
                        just 15 rain-soaked days, making floods and droughts a fact of life in the country. There has
                        traditionally been
                        a scarcity of water in arid regions because of geographical reasons. Presently, we face water
                        scarcity
                        not intrinsically because of geography but mainly due to the lack of an appropriate water
                        management
                        system, calling for a fundamental reassessment of how the country manages water.
                    </p>

                    <p>India simultaneously witnesses floods in Bihar, drought in MP, heavy rains in Chennai, and a
                        persisting water crisis in the metropolitan cities of Tamil Nadu. What surprises me the most is
                        that it
                        took 70 years and a visionary leader to realize that “Ghar Ghar Jal” is a necessity rather than
                        a luxury.
                    </p>

                    <p>Traditionally, there has been a close link between water and society in India. In the past, each
                        region
                        had its own water management system synchronous to the sociocultural context, depending on local
                        topography and climatic conditions.
                    </p>

                    <p>Tanka in Thar, Rajasthan, Johads in the arid North are structures built to catch, hold, and store
                        rainwater in the arid regions. Naulas and Kuhls in the hilly areas of Medieval India had issues
                        of both
                        floods and droughts regularly. The basis of traditional water management in the arid regions was
                        to
                        harness the rainwater through harvesting and conservation. In regions with hilly topography,
                        surface
                        water was harnessed for consumption
                    </p>

                    <p>The feigned notion of “modernization” eroded India’s rich tradition of local community-level
                        water
                        management systems. However, with a concerted effort of NGOs and enlightened individuals, a
                        steady revival in traditional water management systems has been observed in recent times.
                    </p>

                    <p>With the country already experiencing water stress, there is an urgent need to augment the water
                        supply in water-scarce and urban regions. A proper and efficient management structure needs to
                        be
                        implemented to make sustainable use of water possible.
                    </p>

                    <p>A direct step is the need of the hour. Without it, we will be in a similar position as Saudi,
                        where the
                        price of a litre of Water exceeds the cost of Petrol.
